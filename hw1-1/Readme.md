# HW1-1
Actual task part :  
    DNN_mnist.py :  
        This script will download mnist data by using keras api in tensorflow, and build two models.  
        One is deep (three hidden layers), having 99710 parameters.  
        One is shallow (two hidden layers), having 99822 parameters.  
        The script is written in tensorflow1.10.0 and python3.6.5.  
        Please use instruction in terminal like: "python DNN_mnist.py"  
        It will plot two charts(loss and acc).  

CNN.py:  
        To run, type "python CNN.py" in terminal.  
        Python 3.6 is recommended.  
        This script trains 3 CNN models and plots their accuracies and losses after 300 steps.  
        The figures are saved as "Loss.png" and "Accuracy.png"
